# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

## Answer
I believe that the repeated work in the original code was that we were recomputing the factorials. In my code I first create two vectors, I then iterate n times and on the first line in the loop I compute the factorial values and store them in an vector and on the second line I calculate the values using the precalculated factorial values. As we are just iterating through a loop it takes $n$. We then sum up the computed values using a reduce which also takes $n$. So in total my code takes $\Theta(n + n)$ which can be simplified to $\Theta(n)$.
